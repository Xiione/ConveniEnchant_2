notify-update: true

## Table Config ##

#Should an enchanting table be placed at the location where the table item is placed?
#If set to true, item-material must represent the Material of a placeable block.
#If set to false, the enchanting GUI will simply open whenever the player right-clicks with the item.
place-table-block: true

#What should the default values for a crafted table be?
item-level-default: 0
item-exp-default: 0
item-lapis-default: 0

#What should the default maximum bookshelf-level be?
#The vanilla maximum is 15, as an enchanting table will reach its max level req (30) when 15 bookshelves are placed around it.
#Feel free to play around with this value.
#From my own testing, the enchanting offers stop being functional at around level req 70.
level-cap-default: 15

#How many levels should be required to reach the default (safe) bookshelf-level of 15?
#Experience requirements are calculated with the same formula as vanilla player experience levels 1 through 15.
#The wiki page on experience level calculation can be found here: https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Experience#Leveling_up
#However, the experience gained per enchant is calculated as such:
#The enchant offer cost (represented by the green number on the left side of the offer slot) chosen is multiplied by the exp-gained-modifier.
#So, for the default modifier of 5, 63 (315/5) raw experience levels will be consumed in order to reach bookshelf-level 15.
exp-gained-modifier: 5

#How many levels should the table be allowed to gain per enchant?
levels-gained-cap: 1

#Should a sound be played when the table levels up?
#If so, what sound should be played, and at what volume and pitch?
#Find the Spigot sound enums here: https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/Sound.html
level-up-playsound: true
level-up-sound: "ENTITY_PLAYER_LEVELUP"
level-up-sound-volume: 1.0
level-up-sound-pitch: 1.0

#Should the "(Enchantment) (level)...?" hover tooltip be disabled in the enchanting GUI of placed tables?
#It is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED to leave this true. Because of certain oversights/limitations of the Spigot API, enchant offers with custom costs will not display tooltips accurate to the set cost.
#In addition, also as a result of the Spigot API, players are able to shuffle the displayed offers by simply removing and replacing the desired item to enchant.
#However, the behavior of the vanilla enchanting GUI will not be affected, unless a nasty bug occurs.
hide-enchant-hints: true

#Should the placed table follow vanilla enchanting calculation when placed near physical bookshelves?
allow-bookshelf-bonus: false

#Should the table save the amount of Lapis Lazuli left in its slot when the GUI is closed?
allow-lapis-storage: true

#Should the plugin attempt to return the table item directly to the enchanter's inventory when the enchanting GUI is closed?
#If set to false, the table will drop as an item at the placed table or the player's location when the GUI is closed.
return-table-item: true


## Display Config##

#What should be the default display name for the table item? Color codes are accepted.
#The name is automatically set when the table is crafted and when the enchanting GUI is closed.
item-display-name: "&eEnchanting Table"

#What should be the default lore format for the table item? Color codes are accepted.
#Similarly to the display name, the lore is automatically updated when the enchanting GUI is closed.
#The following placeholders can be used:
#For empty lore, simply replace the field with item-lore: []

# %level% - The table's bookshelf-level
# %lapis% - The amount of lapis lazuli stored in the item
# %exp_total% - The total amount of table experience stored in the item
# %exp_remaining% - The amount of table experience until the next bookshelf-level is reached
# %exp_progress% - The percent (%) of experience accumulated towards the next bookshelf-level
item-lore:
  - "&7Level &f%level%"
  - "&f%lapis%&7x Lapis Lazuli"
  - "&f%exp_progress%&7% experience"

#What should the material of the table item be?
#Value must be a Material representing a placeable block.
#Find the Spigot material enums here: https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/Material.html
item-material: "PLAYER_HEAD"

#What should the table item's head texture be?
#Only applies if item-material is "PLAYER_HEAD".
#You can find these values in the NBT data (give command) to most custom heads.
item-head-uuid: "1e3e760a-4c93-4607-96d4-79963a5391f2"
item-head-texture-string: "eyJ0ZXh0dXJlcyI6eyJTS0lOIjp7InVybCI6Imh0dHA6Ly90ZXh0dXJlcy5taW5lY3JhZnQubmV0L3RleHR1cmUvYjJmNzkwMTZjYWQ4NGQxYWUyMTYwOWM0ODEzNzgyNTk4ZTM4Nzk2MWJlMTNjMTU2ODI3NTJmMTI2ZGNlN2EifX19"

recipe-middle: " T "
recipe-bottom: " C "

#How many of the item should be given when the item is crafted?
crafting-output-amount: 1

  - "T,ENCHANTING_TABLE"
